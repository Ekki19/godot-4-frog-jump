# godot-4-frog-jump
the one and only frog who jumps on lilypads

For now I'm dumping a few planning ideas here:
	
	USER INPUT
	
	I was thinking for a simple jump you could click anywhere on screen,
	not just on the lilypad itself. This could be more user-friendly.
	The gameplay would focus more on timing. A long jump could be done by
	tapping and holding, then pulling opposite the desired direction anywhere
	on scrren
	
	DESIGNING LEVEL AND INCREASING DIFFICULTY
	
	I was thinking we could define patterns that make sense level design wise.
	Then a run would consist of a lot of small segments combined. We could make a lot 
	of interesting segments with different difficulties and well thought out level design.
	One segment should be very short (a few lilypads), so in combination, they
	would not seem repetetive. We have to offer good challenges for time
	based jumping and so on. Then we write a method for choosing a random segment
	that fits the desired difficulty and connect it to the path. I think it would
	be an easy implementation that would give us a lot of control.
	
	ART STYLE
	
	I would come up with a concept once we have basic controls and features ready.
